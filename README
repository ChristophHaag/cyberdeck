Ibex - 3D Virtual Reality Desktop/Compositing Manager for X11 and Linux

About
-----
Ibex is a simple 3D Virtual Reality (VR) world that will allow you to have a
number of virtual monitors that contain your current actual desktop.  The idea
is for you to have a pretty virtual world to work in regardless of where you are
so that you can be flying on a plane, for example, but still be flanked by
multiple large high resolution monitors and still be effective rather than be
limited by a tiny laptop screen.

Launch
------
Default simple renderer: ./ibex
Fancy Irrlicht renderer with Quake 3 level: ./ibex -i
Ogre3D renderer with simple terrain and water: ./ibex -o
Disable Side-by-Side rendering: -m (for mono)

Controls
--------
Toggle Control Desktop/Move Around World: CTRL+SHIFT+Y
Look: Move Mouse
Move Forward: W
Move Backwards: S
Walk Sideways Left (Strafe Left): A/Q
Walk Sideways Right (Strafe Right): D/E 
Jump: SPACE (irrlicht renderer only)

Toggle Barrel Lens Distort: B
Toggle Ground Layer: G

If using the iPhone controller app (source included) you need to connect to the
correct IP for your computer in the iPhone app.  When you hit "Broadcast" the
orientation of the phone becomes the base orientation and you will start looking
around from there.
