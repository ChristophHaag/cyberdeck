Ibex - 3D Virtual Reality Compositing Manager for X11 and Linux

About
-----
Ibex is a simple 3D Virtual Reality (VR) world that will allow you to have a
number of virtual monitors that contain your current actual desktop.  The idea
is for you to have a pretty virtual world to work in regardless of where you are
so that you can be flying on a plane, for example, but still be flanked by
multiple large high resolution monitors and still be effective rather than be
limited by a tiny laptop screen.

Controls
--------
Toggle Control Desktop/Move Around World: CTRL+SHIFT+Y
Look: Move Mouse
Move Forward: W
Move Backwards: S
Walk Sideways Left (Strafe Left): A/Q
Walk Sideways Right (Strafe Right): D/E
