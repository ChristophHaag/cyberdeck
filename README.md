**Ibex** 3D Virtual Reality Desktop/Compositing Manager for X11/Linux, Windows and Mac OS

# About
Ibex is a simple 3D Virtual Reality (VR) world that will allow you to have a number of virtual monitors that contain your current actual desktop or the ability to watch movies.  The idea is for you to have a pretty virtual world to work in regardless of where you are
so that you can be flying on a plane, for example, but still be flanked by multiple large high resolution monitors and still be effective rather than be limited by a tiny laptop screen.  In addition, through the eventual use of plugins you can change your environment to suit your needs so you can work in a giant castle or out in a serene field.

It currently supports the Rift on Windows and Mac OS and when the SDK is updated Linux as well.  If you have a Razer Hydra you can use it to look and walk around.

Networking and multi-user support, physics engine and plugin support are all coming.  Movie playing has gotten intial support on the Mac as well.

If using the iPhone controller app (source included) you need to connect to the
correct IP for your computer in the iPhone app.  When you hit "Broadcast" the
orientation of the phone becomes the base orientation and you will start looking
around from there.

## Requirements
### Mac
XCode 5.0.2+, OSX 10.9 (Mavericks), Intel HD3000 or better (OpenGL 3.3+) - Build and run from XCode, check the project dependencies to find out where the bullet3d physics library and sixense SDK need to go to build properly.  OculusSDK needs to be placed at the same level as your checked-out git repo for ibex and it must be version 0.2.5 or later.  You'll need to rebuild the libovr.a library with C++ RTTI and Exceptions enabled or else it won't link properly with ibex.

The [Oculus SDK](https://developer.oculusvr.com) and [sixense SDK](http://sixense.com/developers) must be installed at the same level as the ibex repository directory:

    * Parent Directory:
    |
    |->ibex
       |...
       |->IbexMac
       |->IbexWin
    |
    |->sixenseSDK_linux_OSX
    |
    |->OculusSDK

For math and video support you need to install the following:

    brew install glm
    
    brew install x264 xvid yasm faac
    brew install ffmpeg --use-clang
    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install opencv --env=std
    
bullet physics how to build:

    cd ~/Downloads/bullet-2.81-rev2613
    mkdir bullet-build
    cd bullet-build
    cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DINSTALL_LIBS=ON #-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON                                                                                                                   
    make -j4
    sudo make install
    
Updated cmake install method for regular build:

	# at the same level as the ibex checkout directory
    mkdir build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd` ../ibex/IbexMac
    # or with Ogre
    # cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd` ../ibex/IbexMac -DOGRE=1
    make install
or

	# at the same level as the ibex checkout directory
	mkdir build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd` ../ibex/IbexMac -G Xcode
    # or with Ogre
    # cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd` ../ibex/IbexMac -DOGRE=1 -G Xcode
    # switch to the ibex_run target and hit Command+B

### Windows
Visual Studio 2012 - Build and run from Visual Studio, Rift SDK must be at same level as ibex folder and named: OculusSDK.

You also need to have ffmpeg installed where VS can find it.  I recommend the builds from ([http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ "http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/")).  You should download the 32-bit shared and dev builds and extract them at the same level as ibex.

The [Oculus SDK](https://developer.oculusvr.com) and [sixense SDK](http://sixense.com/developers) must also be extracted at the same level as your repository.

Your directory structure should look like:

    * Parent Directory:
    |
    |->ibex
       |...
       |->IbexMac
       |->IbexWin
    |->ffmpeg
       |
       |->lib
    |->ffmpeg-shared
       |
       |->bin
    |->OculusSDK

### Linux
Setting up my Ubuntu 13.04 install:

    sudo apt-get install mesa-utils eclipse-cdt freeglut3-dev glew-utils libglew1.6-dev libxrender-dev libxrender1-dbg libxrender1 libxdamage-dev libxdamage1-dbg libxcomposite1-dbg libxcomposite-dev libxxf86vm-dev libxxf86vm1-dbg libxcb1-dev libxrandr-dev libxft-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev cmake

    sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev

* Blender
* Blender2Ogre to convert models to Ogre meshes: [Blender2Ogre](https://code.google.com/p/blender2ogre/)
 
To run:  

    cd ~/workspace  
    mkdir build  
    cd build  
    cmake ../ibex
